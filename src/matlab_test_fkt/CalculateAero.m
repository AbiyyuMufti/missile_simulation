% needed parameter are 
% air_density
% area: Surface area of the link.
% a0: The initial "alpha" or initial angle of attack. a0 is also the y-intercept of the alpha-lift coefficient curve.
% cla: The ratio of the coefficient of lift and alpha slope before stall. Slope of the first portion of the alpha-lift coefficient curve.
% cda: The ratio of the coefficient of drag and alpha slope before stall.
% cp: Center of pressure. The forces due to lift and drag will be applied here.
% forward: 
% upward:
% alpha_stall :Angle of attack at stall point; the peak angle of attack.
% cla_stall: The ratio of coefficient of lift and alpha slope after stall. Slope of the second portion of the alpha-lift coefficient curve.
% cda_stall: The ratio of coefficient of drag and alpha slope after stall.
